Hello! Interestingly, I got introduced to programming in my freshman year at [NIT Kurukshetra](https://nitkkr.ac.in/). My interest in coding started back in 2020 during first year of B.tech . Since then, I started learning programming languages & solving problems based on data structure and algorithms. Most importantly I'm a [Problem Solver](https://leetcode.com/dhruvsinghal1973/).

Today, I'm currently pursuing my Bachelors of Technology (2020-2024) with `8.81` GPA aggregate.

Also I've knowledge of Web Development and created some projects on that using HTML, CSS, Javascript / React.js / Next.js, MongoDB and some other cool libraries and frameworks. I'm also part of some student organisations and Leading one of them.

Here is a list of the technologies that I've worked with.
